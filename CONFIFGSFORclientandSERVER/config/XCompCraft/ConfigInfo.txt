This is the SimpleDim Dimension Configuration Information file. It should tell you how to write and
set up your server's custom dimensions. It is created the first time XCompCraft is run in an
instance and may not be updated to reflect changes that occur after the first run.
For the most up-to-date information, please visit:

Every dimension entry consists of a name, followed by a parameter list in the form:
	
	myCustomDimension { parameter: value; parameter: value; parameter: value; }

SimpleDim will try to parse your configs to the best of its ability, however, it is ultimately up
to you to set up the parameters and values correctly. For instance, if you install other dimension
mods, you must take care to avoid creating a SimpleDim dimension that shares a dimension ID with
one of these mods.

Parameters:

There are two parameters required for all dimensions:

	id : The dimension ID of the dimension - take care to not collide with other SimpleDim or other
			mods' dimensions! (This may be trickier if you use Mystcraft.)
			Integer to use as the dimension ID.
	
	type : The type of terrain the dimension will consist of. Currently, the supported types are:
			overworld - Will create an overworld type dimension. Use the seed parameter with this
						type to produce a different overworld, or no seed to clone it.
			superflat - Creates a dimension in the style of the Minecraft Superflat world type.
						Use with the generator parameter to customize the result to your liking.
			singleBiome - Creates a world that contains only one biome. Use with the biome
						parameter to set which biome is used, and the seed parameter to change up
						the terrain if desired.
			void - Creates an empty world with nothing inside.

These parameters can be used with any dimension type:
	
	spawn: Used to set the spawn location of the dimension.
			Set of 3 comma separated integers. Enclosing with parentheses is recommended, but not
			strictly required. (x, y, z) where y cannot be negative. (Don't spawn under the world!)
			Usable with all world types.
	
	seed: Sets the seed for the dimension, overriding the global server seed. Useful to recreate
			your perfect world in a dimension, or bring past servers to your new server with
			seamless terrain generation.
			Integer to use as the seed. Can be specified in decimal with optional negative sign (-)
			or as a hexadecimal value.
			Applicable to 'superflat', 'overworld' and 'singleBiome' types. (Void type may use it,
			but will not affect terrain, since there is none.)
	
	loadSpawn: Whether or not the spawn of the dimension should be loaded regardless of whether
			players are present. May help speed up transfer time to the dimension.
			Either 'true' or 'false. Other values will be ignored.
	
Other types of parameters are used in conjunction with specific types of dimensions:
	
	generator: Used with the 'superflat' type. Controls what the world consists of. Uses the same
			format as the Superflat configuration screen, such as what you can build and customize
			using http://www.minecraft101.net/superflat/
			Must be enclosed with either single or double quotes.
			Only applicable to 'superflat' type.
	
	biome: Used to set the biome of 'singleBiome' worlds, specified as the biome name without
			spaces. "plains", "extremeHills", "mushroomIsland" etc. Mod biomes that have assigned
			names are supported.
			Name of the biome.
			Only applicable to 'singleBiome' type.

Example Dimension Entries:

customAge { id: 16; type: overworld; spawn: (12, 75, -153); seed: 15203824 }

	- Creates an Overworld type dimension with spawn set to (12, 75, -153) and a seed of 15203824.

justAVoid { id: -2; type: void }

	- Creates a void age with dimension ID 2.

justGrassAndSlimes { id: 3; type: superflat; generator: "2;7,2x3,2;1;village" }

	- Creates a dimension similar to the default Superflat setting.


To transport between SimpleDim dimensions, you may specify items in the config file. Each transport
item follows a similar entry as dimensions, in the format:

	item The Item Name In-game { parameter: value; parameter: value }

The text that follows the item keyword will be used as the display name of the item in-game, less
the trailing space, and will also be registered in the Game Registry with the provided name. Item
entries have two required parameters:

	forDimension: text identifying the dimension the item is linked to. Must be one of the
			dimensions defined in one of the SimpleDim config files.
	
	type: visual representation of the teleporter item. Must be one of the valid types in the
			following table.
			
Item Types:
Each type is listed with the number of layers, and any available variants.

	accessCard - gives the appearance of a credit-card type item.
			3 layers. variants: [1, 1, 1]
	pocketwatch - gives the appearance of a pocket watch or locket item.
			2 layers, variants: [1, 2]


Optional parameters are:

	colours: Add colour to the teleporter icon's layers. Takes a list of numbers corresponding to
			values in RGB format, length should not exceed the number of layers in the type.
			Of the format: [ number, number, number ]
			Number may either be hexadecimal or base 10.
			
	variant: A list of numbers corresponding to available variants. If no variant is available
			for the layer, use 0. Must be strictly less than the number of variants for a layer.
			Of the format: [ number, number, number ]
			Number must be base 10.
			
	displayName: If using MineTweaker or similar mods to add recipes for the teleport item, use
			this parameter to override the display name of the item, and don't use spaces in the
			string provided to the item definition.
